    <h2>General information</h2>

    <p>The following project "CrowdDefense" is a student project from students at the Saarland University.</p>
    <h2>Voluntary participation and freely given consent</h2>

    <p>Participation in the study is voluntary. The consent to participate in this study can be revoked at any time
        and
        without giving reasons until the end of the data collection process by deleting your account <a
            href="">here</a>. All incomplete data records will be
        deleted
        by us. After the end of data collection, the statutory rights of revocation, information, correction,
        blocking
        and deletion can no longer be exercised because the data can no longer be attributed to the data subject, as
        long as the username is not disclosed to us.

    <h2>What data do we collect from you?</h2>

    <p> After consent to the collection of data, the following data is collected and processed: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Entries in the online survey,</li>
        <li>Username chosen by participant (ensure that this name does not allow any inferences to you personally, e.g.,
            because you re-use your typical user name),</li>
        <li>Internal game data such as ideas suggested, games played, shots fired, etc.</li>
        <li>As new releases appear on this web page, data corresponding to these new features will be also logged.
