            <h2>General information</h2>
        
            <p>The following project "CrowdDefense" is a student project from students at the Saarland University.</p>
        
            <h2>Voluntary participation and freely given consent</h2>
        
            <p>Participation in the study is voluntary. The consent to participate in this study can be revoked at any time and without giving reasons until the end of the data collection process by either ending the survey (a corresponding button is available on the website) or closing the browser window. All incomplete data records will be deleted by us. After the end of data collection, the statutory rights of revocation, information, correction, blocking and deletion can no longer be exercised because the data can no longer be attributed to the data subject.</p>
        
            <h2>What data do we collect from you?</h2>
        
            <p> After consent to the collection of data, the following data are collected and processed: </p>

                <li>E-Mail address and username</li>
                <li>Game data such as games played, shots fired, etc.</li>
            </ul> 
        
            <p> For technical reasons, data such as the following, which your internet browser transmits to us or to our web space provider (so called server log files), is collected: </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>type and version of the browser you use</li>
                <li>operating system</li>

                <li>date and time of your visit</li>

            <p>This anonymous data is not merged with the survey data. On this website we use so-called cookies. Cookies are small files that are stored by your web browser.

            <h2>Anonymization of data</h2>
        
            <p> With the transfer of the collected data to our server, an anonymization takes place, which makes it practically impossible to assign the collected data to a person, as long as no personal data is entered in free text fields. </p>
        
            <h2>What do we use your data for?</h2>
        
            <p> The results and data are used for scientific research purposes and will be published anonymously as part of the final report by the DFKI and as a scientific publication of this study. They can also be processed anonymously for other scientific  </p>research purposes. In this sense, the data will be shared with the responsible persons at the DFKI.
        
            <h2>Contact person</h2>
