## What even is this?

Welcome to Crowdjump2, a game which is currently developed through the ideas and suggestions of its community. Seref Güngör, Jan Larisch and [Jan-Robin Auman](https://beemo.at) from Saarland University created Crowdjump2 aswell as this website with support from [Dr. Pascal Lessel at the DFKI](https://umtl.cs.uni-saarland.de/people/pascal-lessel.html).

We built a very simple tower defense game, but we need **your** help to make it more interesting!

## How do you get involved?

In our message board all community members can create, share, upvote and downvote suggestions for new game features.

Everyday at 9am and 7pm, the highest voted suggestion is picked, given a time estimate and implemented. We aspire to completing it in 24 hours. Why? Because a new version of Crowdjump2 will go live every day at 7pm, and we want to have it available (*if possible*) to you for that daily release so the game stays interesting and engaging!

## What kind of stuff should I suggest?

Suggestions can be as simple or complicated as you like. Maybe you just want a prettier game, or you have specific ideas on how the gameplay could become more interesting and rewarding.

Share your ideas with the community, and just see how people react!

Your suggestions are the most powerful tool to make this an engaging experience, and can not only affect the game but also the community and process around it.

If you’re unhappy with the way suggestions are chosen or the release times are in your opinion supotimal then share your concerns with the rest of the crowd!

## Why are we doing this?

Crowdjump2 is part of a study on User-Driven-Game-Development that will be conducted starting from the 10th of January 2020 untl the second of february.

After that date, the study will conclude and the game will be taken down.

During the time however we hope to collect information on how the community plays the game and how it suggests new features.
We also ask our community members to take part in our questionnaires. They are very important as they'll allow us to get conclusive insight from the study.
